Hi!
This is a webpage featuring a sketch pad acting like etch a sketch - when you hover over a "pixel" it will change color.
You can clear the board witch "CLEAR" button, change color witch "COLOR" button and change size of the board with "SIZE" button.
The size accepts values between 1 and 640 (but values around 640 will lag your browser because it generates A LOT of squares (640*640 so yeah).

Webpage also features darkmode.
The eclipse icon is from https://icon-icons.com/.
